# hello-world
This is my very first GitHub repository.  A place where I store ideas, resources, snd/or share ideas with others.
I am a semi-retired software systems engineer, interested in keeping my hand in on current developments and perhapse doing some coding.
I started work as an avionics technician many more years ago thn I care to remember. After graduating in Electrical and Electronic Engineering I worked on flight simulator software in Assember, and progressed through military and aerospace systems, and eventually light rail SCADA and Control Centre Comms.
I an a CITP with the British Computer Society.  I also do Expert Witness work.
